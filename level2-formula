They're not actually different formulas—they describe **different aspects** of what current is.[1][2]

## What Current Actually Is

Current \(I\) is the rate at which electric charge flows, so \(I = \frac{Q}{t}\) is the **definition** of current: charge \(Q\) (in coulombs) passing a point per unit time \(t\) (in seconds).[11][12]

## Ohm's Law

The formula \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) comes from Ohm's law, which describes the **relationship** between current, voltage, and resistance in a circuit. It tells you how much current will flow when you apply a voltage across a resistance. This happens because the voltage creates an electric field that causes electrons to drift through the conductor, colliding with atoms and losing energy as heat.[2][7][1]

## Why Both Matter

- Use \(I = \frac{Q}{t}\) when you're thinking about **how much charge** is moving (e.g., in electroplating, battery discharge)
- Use \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) when you're **designing or troubleshooting circuits**—working out what current will flow for a given supply voltage and load resistance[6][7]

As an electrician, you'll use \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) constantly for calculating circuit currents, cable sizing, and checking if protective devices are correctly rated.

The main formula electricians use for current is from Ohm’s law:  
\(\displaystyle I = \frac{V}{R}\)[5][7]

- \(I\) = current in amperes (A)  
- \(V\) = voltage in volts (V)  
- \(R\) = resistance in ohms \(\Omega\)[7][5]

Another useful relationship is with charge and time:  
\(\displaystyle I = \frac{Q}{t}\) where \(Q\) is charge in coulombs (C) and \(t\) is time in seconds (s).[3][6]
