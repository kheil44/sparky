They're not actually different formulas—they describe **different aspects** of what current is.[1][2]

## What Current Actually Is

Current \(I\) is the rate at which electric charge flows, so \(I = \frac{Q}{t}\) is the **definition** of current: charge \(Q\) (in coulombs) passing a point per unit time \(t\) (in seconds).[11][12]

## Ohm's Law

The formula \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) comes from Ohm's law, which describes the **relationship** between current, voltage, and resistance in a circuit. It tells you how much current will flow when you apply a voltage across a resistance. This happens because the voltage creates an electric field that causes electrons to drift through the conductor, colliding with atoms and losing energy as heat.[2][7][1]

## Why Both Matter

- Use \(I = \frac{Q}{t}\) when you're thinking about **how much charge** is moving (e.g., in electroplating, battery discharge)
- Use \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) when you're **designing or troubleshooting circuits**—working out what current will flow for a given supply voltage and load resistance[6][7]

As an electrician, you'll use \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) constantly for calculating circuit currents, cable sizing, and checking if protective devices are correctly rated.

The main formula electricians use for current is from Ohm’s law:  
\(\displaystyle I = \frac{V}{R}\)[5][7]

- \(I\) = current in amperes (A)  
- \(V\) = voltage in volts (V)  
- \(R\) = resistance in ohms \(\Omega\)[7][5]

Another useful relationship is with charge and time:  
\(\displaystyle I = \frac{Q}{t}\) where \(Q\) is charge in coulombs (C) and \(t\) is time in seconds (s).[3][6]

Here are the main area formulas you’ll actually use (especially on site for basic maths).  

## Rectangles and triangles

- Rectangle / square: \(A = \text{length} \times \text{width}\)  
- Triangle: \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\)

## Circles (good for cables, holes, pipes)

- Circle: \(A = \pi r^{2}\) where \(r\) is radius  
- If you know diameter \(d\): \(A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^{2} = \frac{\pi d^{2}}{4}\)

## Sectors and parts of circles

- Sector (slice of a circle), angle \(\theta\) in degrees:  
  \(A = \frac{\theta}{360} \pi r^{2}\)  
- Sector, angle \(\theta\) in radians:  
  \(A = \frac{1}{2} r^{2} \theta\)

## Other common shapes

- Parallelogram: \(A = \text{base} \times \text{height}\)  
- Trapezium (trapezoid): \(A = \frac{1}{2} (\text{a} + \text{b}) \times h\)  
  where a and b are the two parallel sides, \(h\) is the height  

If you tell what shapes you’re working with (floors, walls, cable cross‑section, etc.), the formulas can be narrowed to exactly what you need.

Here are the main volume formulas you’ll actually use.

## Basic prisms and boxes

- Cube (all sides same): \(V = s^{3}\) where \(s\) is side length.[4][5]
- Rectangular box (room, trunking run, etc.): \(V = l \times w \times h\).[5][4]
- General prism: \(V = \text{area of cross‑section} \times \text{length}\).[5]

## Cylinders and pipes

- Cylinder (round duct, pipe, drum): \(V = \pi r^{2} h\) where \(r\) is radius, \(h\) is height/length.[5]
- Using diameter \(d\): \(V = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^{2} h = \frac{\pi d^{2}}{4} h\).[5]

## Pyramids, cones, spheres

- Pyramid (including rectangular pyramid): \(V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times h\).[5]
- Cone: \(V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h\).[5]
- Sphere: \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}\).[4][5]

## Practical tip

For anything “regular”:  
1) Work out the area of the base or cross‑section.  
2) Multiply by the length/height to get volume.  

If you tell what shape you’re dealing with (room, duct, drum, cable void, etc.), the formula can be picked and used step‑by‑step.

Density tells you how much mass there is in a certain volume. The formula is:

\(\rho = \dfrac{m}{V}\)

- \(\rho\) (rho) = density  
- \(m\) = mass  
- \(V\) = volume  

Common units are kg/m³ or g/cm³. If you know any two of density, mass, and volume, you can rearrange:

- \(m = \rho \times V\)  
- \(V = \dfrac{m}{\rho}\)

Here are the key triangle and Pythagoras formulas you’ll need.


Main formula:  
\[
c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}
\]

Rearranged to find a shorter side:

- \(a^{2} = c^{2} - b^{2}\)  
- \(b^{2} = c^{2} - a^{2}\)

If you tell which bits you usually get given (for example, “two sides and need the third” or “base and angle”), the formulas can be narrowed to what you’ll see most as an electrician.

For basic trigonometry you mainly need the right‑angle triangle ratios and how to use them.

## Trig ratios (SOH CAH TOA)

For an angle \(\theta\) in a right‑angled triangle:

- \(\sin(\theta) = \dfrac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)  
- \(\cos(\theta) = \dfrac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)  
- \(\tan(\theta) = \dfrac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\)

“Opposite” and “adjacent” are relative to the angle you’re using, and the hypotenuse is always the longest side.

## Using trig to find sides

Given an angle \(\theta\) and one side:

- Opposite side: \(\text{opp} = \sin(\theta) \times \text{hyp}\)  
- Adjacent side: \(\text{adj} = \cos(\theta) \times \text{hyp}\)  
- Hypotenuse: \(\text{hyp} = \dfrac{\text{opp}}{\sin(\theta)} = \dfrac{\text{adj}}{\cos(\theta)}\)  
- If you know opposite and adjacent: \(\text{opp} = \tan(\theta) \times \text{adj}\) or \(\text{adj} = \dfrac{\text{opp}}{\tan(\theta)}\)

These are exactly what you use for things like cable runs on diagonals, ladder rack at angles, or working with power triangles (real/reactive/apparent power).

The symbol "U" is used for voltage mainly in European and German electrical engineering contexts. It originates from the German word "Unterschied," which means "difference," referring to potential difference (voltage). The letter "U" was chosen because it was largely unused in other electrical symbols and less likely to cause confusion than "V," which can also represent velocity.[1]

In contrast, "V" is the more common symbol for voltage internationally and is named after Alessandro Volta, who invented the battery. In historical and some physics contexts, "E" is also used to denote electromotive force (voltage).[2][1]

Practically, "U" and "V" mean the same quantity (voltage), but "U" is preferred in many European standards and documents to clearly distinguish voltage from other quantities.[7][1]

Here is a detailed explanation for the uses, why, when, and how to connect each meter in the order you requested:

### Ammeter
- **Use**: Measures electric current flowing through a circuit (in amperes, A).  
- **Why**: To check how much current is passing to ensure it does not exceed safe levels or to diagnose circuit operation.  
- **When**: Use when you need to measure current in any part of the circuit.  
- **How to connect**: Connect in **series** with the circuit component so the entire current flows through the ammeter. It must have very low internal resistance to avoid dropping voltage and affecting circuit operation.

### Voltmeter
- **Use**: Measures the potential difference (voltage) between two points (in volts, V).  
- **Why**: To check the voltage supply or the drop across components to verify correct operation or troubleshoot faults.  
- **When**: Use when voltage info is needed without interrupting current flow.  
- **How to connect**: Connect in **parallel** across the component or points where voltage is being measured. It has high internal resistance so it draws minimal current and does not affect the circuit.

### Wattmeter
- **Use**: Measures electrical power consumed by a load (in watts, W).  
- **Why**: To know how much power a device or circuit is using, important for energy monitoring or sizing equipment.  
- **When**: Use when power consumption monitoring is required.  
- **How to connect**: Usually connected with the current coil in series with the load (like an ammeter) and the voltage coil in parallel across the load (like a voltmeter) to measure real power.

### Ohmmeter
- **Use**: Measures electrical resistance of components or circuits (in ohms, Ω).  
- **Why**: To check for continuity, identify component values, or find faults such as open circuits.  
- **When**: Use when the circuit power is off and you want to measure resistance safely.  
- **How to connect**: Connect the ohmmeter **across** the component or section being measured (like a voltmeter, in parallel) but circuit must be de-energized. Ohmmeter applies a small voltage internally and measures current to calculate resistance.

Each instrument is matched to how it interacts with circuit current or voltage to provide accurate, safe readings without disrupting normal circuit function.[1][4][6][9]

The main formulas for force in electrical and physics contexts are:

1. **Electric force between two charges (Coulomb's Law):**  
\[
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
\]
- \(F\) = electric force (Newtons, N)  
- \(k\) = Coulomb's constant \(\approx 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}^2\)  
- \(q_1, q_2\) = magnitudes of the charges (Coulombs, C)  
- \(r\) = distance between charges (meters, m)  
This force is attractive if charges are opposite and repulsive if the same.[1][2][4]

2. **Force from electric field on a charge:**  
\[
F = E \times q
\]
- \(E\) = electric field strength (N/C or V/m)  
- \(q\) = charge (C)  
This describes the force on a charge \(q\) in an electric field \(E\).[6]

3. **General force formula (Newton's second law):**  
\[
F = m \times a
\]
- \(F\) = force (N)  
- \(m\) = mass (kg)  
- \(a\) = acceleration (m/s²)  

The first two formulas are the main ones related specifically to electric forces acting between charges or in fields. The third is the universal mechanics formula for force.

Weight is the force exerted on a mass due to gravity. The main formula is:

\[
W = m \times g
\]

- \(W\) = weight (Newtons, N)  
- \(m\) = mass (kilograms, kg)  
- \(g\) = acceleration due to gravity (~9.8 m/s² on Earth)

Weight represents a force, so it depends on both the amount of mass and the gravitational pull acting on it. It is different from mass, which is the amount of matter in an object without regard to gravity.

In summary:  
- Weight is the force caused by gravity pulling on a mass.  
- It is calculated by multiplying mass by gravitational acceleration.[1][2][3]

Weight and force are similar because weight is actually a specific type of force—the gravitational force acting on a mass. The general formula for force is \(F = m \times a\), and weight is the force where the acceleration \(a\) is due to gravity \(g\), so weight \(W = m \times g\).

- Force (\(F\)) is any push or pull on an object, measured in newtons (N), and can be caused by various actions like tension, friction, or gravity.  
- Weight is the force resulting specifically from gravity acting on a mass, so it’s a force with direction (towards the center of the Earth) and magnitude proportional to the mass and gravitational acceleration.

Because weight is a force caused by gravity, it follows the formula for force but with acceleration fixed as \(g \approx 9.8\, m/s^2\), making it a special case of force. This is why weight and force formulas look so similar, but weight always relates to gravitational pull on an object’s mass.[1][5][6]

Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. Here are key formulas related to mass:

1. From force and acceleration (Newton's second law):  
\[
m = \frac{F}{a}
\]
where \(m\) is mass, \(F\) is force, and \(a\) is acceleration.

2. From density and volume:  
\[
m = \rho \times V
\]
where \(\rho\) is density and \(V\) is volume.

3. From weight and gravity:  
\[
m = \frac{W}{g}
\]
where \(W\) is weight and \(g\) is gravitational acceleration (approx. 9.8 m/s²).

These formulas allow mass to be calculated depending on what quantities you know. Mass is constant regardless of location, unlike weight which varies with gravity.[1][2][3][4]

The similarity between mass, weight, and force formulas arises because they are closely related physical quantities but represent different concepts:

- **Mass** is the amount of matter in an object, a scalar quantity usually in kilograms (kg). It is **constant** regardless of location and does not depend on gravity.

- **Weight** is a specific type of force: the gravitational force acting on that mass. It depends on local gravitational acceleration \(g\) (about 9.8 m/s² on Earth). Weight \(W = m \times g\) is a vector force measured in newtons (N).

- **Force** is a broader concept defined as mass multiplied by acceleration (\(F = m \times a\)), encompassing any push or pull, including weight.

Because weight *is* a force (one caused by gravity), its formula is a specific case of the general force formula, where acceleration is gravitational acceleration. Mass differs as it is a measure of matter, not a force. The formulas look similar because weight is calculated by applying Newton’s second law specifically for gravity acting on mass.[1][5][11]

In short:

| Quantity | Definition                              | Formula               | Key Difference                        |
|----------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Mass     | Amount of matter                      | (varies by context)   | Scalar, independent of gravity       |
| Weight   | Gravitational force on a mass        | \(W = m \times g\)     | Force, depends on gravity             |
| Force    | Mass times any acceleration           | \(F = m \times a\)     | Vector, general push or pull force   |

This explains why the formulas are mathematically similar but represent different physical quantities.

Acceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. It tells you how quickly something is speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction.

The basic formula for average acceleration \(a\) is:

\[
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t_f - t_i}
\]

- \(v_f\) = final velocity  
- \(v_i\) = initial velocity  
- \(\Delta v\) = change in velocity  
- \(\Delta t\) = change in time  

Acceleration is a vector, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. It can be positive (speeding up), negative (slowing down, called deceleration), or changing direction even if speed is constant.

Other formulas related to acceleration include:

- From force and mass (Newton's 2nd law):  
  \[
  a = \frac{F}{m}
  \]
- For circular motion (centripetal acceleration):  
  \[
  a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}
  \]
  where \(v\) = speed along the curve, \(r\) = radius of the path

Acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²) in SI units.[1][2][3][4]

Mechanical advantage (MA) is calculated as the ratio of output force (load) to input force (effort):

\[
MA = \frac{F_{output}}{F_{input}} = \frac{F_B}{F_A}
\]

Where:  
- \(F_B\) = force exerted by the load (output force)  
- \(F_A\) = force applied (input or effort force)

If MA > 1, the machine amplifies force (you use less effort to move a larger load).  
If MA < 1, the machine reduces force but increases distance or speed.

For specific simple machines:  
- Lever:  
\[
MA = \frac{\text{length of effort arm}}{\text{length of load arm}}
\]
- Wheel and axle:  
\[
MA = \frac{\text{radius of wheel}}{\text{radius of axle}}
\]
- Inclined plane (ramp):  
\[
MA = \frac{\text{length of slope}}{\text{height}}
\]
- Wedge:  
\[
MA = \frac{\text{length}}{\text{width}}
\]

Mechanical advantage shows how a machine makes work easier by trading force for distance, calculated based on forces or geometric ratios of the machine parts.[1][2][3][4]

A lever is a simple machine consisting of a rigid bar that pivots around a fixed point called the fulcrum. The lever works by using an input force (effort) applied at one point to move a load (output force) at another point, allowing you to amplify force or change its direction to make work easier.

### How a lever works:
- The fulcrum is the pivot point.
- Effort (input force) is applied at a distance from the fulcrum.
- Load (output force) is moved at a different distance from the fulcrum.
- The lever multiplies force based on the relative distances from the fulcrum: the farther the effort from the fulcrum compared to the load, the greater the force amplification.

### Lever formula (Law of the Lever):
\[
F_A \times d_A = F_B \times d_B
\]
- \(F_A\) = Effort force  
- \(d_A\) = Distance from effort to fulcrum  
- \(F_B\) = Load force  
- \(d_B\) = Distance from load to fulcrum  

This means the effort force times its distance from the fulcrum equals the load force times its distance from the fulcrum (moment balance). Rearranged to find mechanical advantage:

\[
MA = \frac{F_B}{F_A} = \frac{d_A}{d_B}
\]

There are three classes of levers based on the position of the fulcrum relative to the effort and load:
- 1st class: Fulcrum between effort and load (e.g., seesaw)
- 2nd class: Load between fulcrum and effort (e.g., wheelbarrow)
- 3rd class: Effort between fulcrum and load (e.g., tweezers)

Levers help amplify input force or increase the distance/speed the load moves, making heavy lifting or moving easier.[2][3][4][5]

Here are the three classes of levers with their working explanation and formulas including mechanical advantage (MA):

### First Class Lever
- **Description**: Fulcrum is between the effort and the load. Effort and load act on opposite sides, can multiply force or change direction.
- **Formula (Law of the Lever)**:  
  \[
  F_A \times d_A = F_B \times d_B
  \]
  or for mechanical advantage:  
  \[
  MA = \frac{d_A}{d_B} = \frac{F_B}{F_A}
  \]
  where \(F_A\) = effort force, \(d_A\) = effort arm distance, \(F_B\) = load force, \(d_B\) = load arm distance.
- **Examples**: Seesaw, crowbar, scissors.

### Second Class Lever  
- **Description**: Load is between fulcrum and effort. Effort arm is longer, so effort is less than load force, force is amplified.
- **Formula for MA**:
  \[
  MA > 1, \quad MA = \frac{d_A}{d_B} = \frac{F_B}{F_A}
  \]
  Similar form as first class, but load always between.
- **Examples**: Wheelbarrow, nutcracker, bottle opener.

### Third Class Lever  
- **Description**: Effort is between fulcrum and load. Effort force greater than load, but load moves faster and farther (increased speed/distance, not force).
- **Formula for MA**:
  \[
  MA < 1, \quad MA = \frac{d_A}{d_B} = \frac{F_B}{F_A}
  \]
- **Examples**: Tweezers, human arm.

In all classes, mechanical advantage relates force and arm length ratios. First class can have MA >, =, or < 1 depending on fulcrum position; second class always MA > 1; third class always MA < 1.

Formulas unify as:
\[
F_A \times d_A = F_B \times d_B
\]
and
\[
MA = \frac{F_B}{F_A} = \frac{d_A}{d_B}
\]

This explains how levers amplify force or increase movement based on relative arm lengths and force applied.[1][2][3]

Pulleys are simple machines used to lift or move loads by changing the direction of force or providing a mechanical advantage to reduce the effort needed.

### Types of Pulleys:
1. **Fixed Pulley:**  
   - The pulley is fixed in place and only changes the direction of the input force.  
   - Mechanical advantage (MA) = 1 (no force multiplication).  
   - Example: Flagpole pulley.

2. **Movable Pulley:**  
   - The pulley moves with the load; it supports the load itself.  
   - Mechanical advantage (MA) = 2 (effort force is halved).  
   - Example: Elevator pulley system.

3. **Block and Tackle:**  
   - A combination of fixed and movable pulleys to provide greater mechanical advantage.  
   - Mechanical advantage is equal to the number of rope segments supporting the load.  
   - Example: Crane lifting systems.

### Mechanical Advantage Formulas:

- For a pulley system:  
\[
MA = \text{Number of rope segments supporting the load}
\]

- If using the effort force \(F_E\) and load force \(F_L\):  
\[
MA = \frac{F_L}{F_E}
\]

Where:  
- \(F_L\) = load force (weight of object)  
- \(F_E\) = effort force applied to lift the load

### How it works:  
The mechanical advantage means the effort needed is reduced by distributing the load across multiple rope sections. However, the rope length you pull must increase proportionally.

In summary, pulleys reduce the force needed to lift heavy loads by using multiple ropes and pulleys, calculated by counting supporting rope segments or by force ratios.[1][3][4][9]

A pulley is a simple machine used to lift heavy loads by changing the direction of the force and/or providing a mechanical advantage.

### Description:
- **Fixed pulley** changes the direction of the force but does not reduce effort.  
- **Movable pulley** moves with the load and reduces the effort needed to lift it.  
- **Block and tackle** combines fixed and movable pulleys to multiply the mechanical advantage.

### Formula:
Mechanical advantage (MA) = Number of rope segments supporting the load.

\[
MA = \frac{F_{load}}{F_{effort}} = \text{Number of supporting ropes}
\]

### Practical Example:
Suppose you have a block and tackle pulley system with 4 supporting rope segments lifting a load of 200 N.

- Number of ropes supporting the load = 4  
- Mechanical advantage \(MA = 4\)

The effort force needed:  
\[
F_{effort} = \frac{F_{load}}{MA} = \frac{200\,N}{4} = 50\,N
\]

You only need to apply 50 N effort to lift a 200 N load.

However, to lift the load 1 meter, you must pull 4 meters of rope (distance trade-off).

This system reduces the effort force by a factor of 4, making heavy lifting easier.[2][3][6]

Gears are simple machines consisting of toothed wheels that mesh together to transmit torque and rotational motion, often to increase force or speed.

### Description:
- Gears work by interlocking teeth, so when one gear (input) turns, it rotates another gear (output).
- They can change the direction of rotation, increase torque (force), or increase speed depending on gear sizes.

### Gear Ratio (Mechanical Advantage) Formula:
\[
\text{Mechanical Advantage (MA)} = \frac{T_{output}}{T_{input}} = \frac{N_{output}}{N_{input}}
\]
Where:
- \(T\) or \(N\) = number of teeth on the gear
- Input gear = driving gear
- Output gear = driven gear

Alternatively, based on gear radii:
\[
MA = \frac{r_{output}}{r_{input}}
\]

### Interpretation:
- If the output gear has more teeth or larger radius than input, MA > 1, meaning force is magnified, but speed decreases.
- If output gear has fewer teeth, MA < 1, meaning speed increases while force decreases.

### Practical Example:
Suppose an input gear has 10 teeth and an output gear has 40 teeth.

- Gear ratio:  
\[
MA = \frac{40}{10} = 4
\]
- This means the output torque is 4 times the input torque.
- However, the output gear turns 4 times slower than the input gear.

This relationship allows gears to trade speed for force or vice versa efficiently in machines.[1][5][6]

Work and power are fundamental concepts in physics describing energy transfer and rate of energy use.

### Work
Work is done when a force causes displacement of an object in the force's direction.

- **Formula:**  
\[
W = F \times d \times \cos(\theta)
\]
Where:  
- \(W\) = work (joules, J)  
- \(F\) = force applied (newtons, N)  
- \(d\) = displacement in direction of force (meters, m)  
- \(\theta\) = angle between force and displacement direction (degrees or radians)

If force and displacement are in the same direction, \(\cos(\theta) = 1\), so:  
\[
W = F \times d
\]

Work is energy transferred by force; positive work results in energy gain, negative work in energy loss.

### Power
Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.

- **Formula:**  
\[
P = \frac{W}{t} = F \times v
\]
Where:  
- \(P\) = power (watts, W)  
- \(W\) = work done (joules, J)  
- \(t\) = time taken (seconds, s)  
- \(v\) = velocity in the direction of force (m/s)

Power measures how fast work is done. One watt equals one joule per second.

### Summary:
- Work relates to force times distance.  
- Power relates to how quickly that work is done over time.

These formulas apply to simple and complex machines to analyze energy transfer and efficiency in mechanical systems.[1][3][6]

\[
W = F \times d \times \cos(\theta)
\]

\[
W = F \times d \quad \text{(when } \theta = 0^\circ \text{)}
\]

\[
P = \frac{W}{t} = F \times v
\]
