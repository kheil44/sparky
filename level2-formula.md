They're not actually different formulas—they describe **different aspects** of what current is.[1][2]

## What Current Actually Is

Current \(I\) is the rate at which electric charge flows, so \(I = \frac{Q}{t}\) is the **definition** of current: charge \(Q\) (in coulombs) passing a point per unit time \(t\) (in seconds).[11][12]

## Ohm's Law

The formula \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) comes from Ohm's law, which describes the **relationship** between current, voltage, and resistance in a circuit. It tells you how much current will flow when you apply a voltage across a resistance. This happens because the voltage creates an electric field that causes electrons to drift through the conductor, colliding with atoms and losing energy as heat.[2][7][1]

## Why Both Matter

- Use \(I = \frac{Q}{t}\) when you're thinking about **how much charge** is moving (e.g., in electroplating, battery discharge)
- Use \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) when you're **designing or troubleshooting circuits**—working out what current will flow for a given supply voltage and load resistance[6][7]

As an electrician, you'll use \(I = \frac{V}{R}\) constantly for calculating circuit currents, cable sizing, and checking if protective devices are correctly rated.

The main formula electricians use for current is from Ohm’s law:  
\(\displaystyle I = \frac{V}{R}\)[5][7]

- \(I\) = current in amperes (A)  
- \(V\) = voltage in volts (V)  
- \(R\) = resistance in ohms \(\Omega\)[7][5]

Another useful relationship is with charge and time:  
\(\displaystyle I = \frac{Q}{t}\) where \(Q\) is charge in coulombs (C) and \(t\) is time in seconds (s).[3][6]

Here are the main area formulas you’ll actually use (especially on site for basic maths).  

## Rectangles and triangles

- Rectangle / square: \(A = \text{length} \times \text{width}\)  
- Triangle: \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\)

## Circles (good for cables, holes, pipes)

- Circle: \(A = \pi r^{2}\) where \(r\) is radius  
- If you know diameter \(d\): \(A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^{2} = \frac{\pi d^{2}}{4}\)

## Sectors and parts of circles

- Sector (slice of a circle), angle \(\theta\) in degrees:  
  \(A = \frac{\theta}{360} \pi r^{2}\)  
- Sector, angle \(\theta\) in radians:  
  \(A = \frac{1}{2} r^{2} \theta\)

## Other common shapes

- Parallelogram: \(A = \text{base} \times \text{height}\)  
- Trapezium (trapezoid): \(A = \frac{1}{2} (\text{a} + \text{b}) \times h\)  
  where a and b are the two parallel sides, \(h\) is the height  

If you tell what shapes you’re working with (floors, walls, cable cross‑section, etc.), the formulas can be narrowed to exactly what you need.

Here are the main volume formulas you’ll actually use.

## Basic prisms and boxes

- Cube (all sides same): \(V = s^{3}\) where \(s\) is side length.[4][5]
- Rectangular box (room, trunking run, etc.): \(V = l \times w \times h\).[5][4]
- General prism: \(V = \text{area of cross‑section} \times \text{length}\).[5]

## Cylinders and pipes

- Cylinder (round duct, pipe, drum): \(V = \pi r^{2} h\) where \(r\) is radius, \(h\) is height/length.[5]
- Using diameter \(d\): \(V = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^{2} h = \frac{\pi d^{2}}{4} h\).[5]

## Pyramids, cones, spheres

- Pyramid (including rectangular pyramid): \(V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times h\).[5]
- Cone: \(V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h\).[5]
- Sphere: \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}\).[4][5]

## Practical tip

For anything “regular”:  
1) Work out the area of the base or cross‑section.  
2) Multiply by the length/height to get volume.  

If you tell what shape you’re dealing with (room, duct, drum, cable void, etc.), the formula can be picked and used step‑by‑step.

Density tells you how much mass there is in a certain volume. The formula is:

\(\rho = \dfrac{m}{V}\)

- \(\rho\) (rho) = density  
- \(m\) = mass  
- \(V\) = volume  

Common units are kg/m³ or g/cm³. If you know any two of density, mass, and volume, you can rearrange:

- \(m = \rho \times V\)  
- \(V = \dfrac{m}{\rho}\)

Here are the key triangle and Pythagoras formulas you’ll need.


Main formula:  
\[
c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}
\]

Rearranged to find a shorter side:

- \(a^{2} = c^{2} - b^{2}\)  
- \(b^{2} = c^{2} - a^{2}\)

If you tell which bits you usually get given (for example, “two sides and need the third” or “base and angle”), the formulas can be narrowed to what you’ll see most as an electrician.
